teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- What *is* data visualization, really?
- What are the roles of visualization in the geospatial data analysis pipeline?
objectives:
- Develop an understanding of the value of learning data visualization tools.
- Develop an understanding of the role of data viz in the geospatial researcher's data pipeline. 
keypoints:
- Visualizing data augments human cognition and, if done right, can lead to richer understanding of the available data. 
- Cartographic visualizations (maps) can draw significant insights from spatial data.
- Data visualization is a tool to assist several steps of the researcher's pipeline, from initial data exploration to communication of final results.

### What is Visualization? <small>(stolen shamelessly from Dr. [Jeffrey Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/)'s [course slides](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse512/18sp/lectures/CSE512-ValueOfVisualization.pdf))</small>

- “Transformation of the **symbolic** into the **geometric”**
 [McCormick et al. 1987]
- "... finding the **artificial memory** that best *supports our
natural means of perception.*” [Bertin 1967]
- “The use of computer-generated, interactive, visual
representations of data to **amplify cognition**.”
[[Card, Mackinlay, & Shneiderman 1999]](http://adrenaline.ucsd.edu/kirsh/fileupload/Diagrams/hegarty.pdf)

### Why Visualization?
- Answer questions (or discover them)
- Make decisions
- See data in context
- Expand memory
- Support graphical calculation
- Find patterns
- Present argument or tell a story
- Inspire
