    "Static maps, like the sort you'd develop for a publication or brochure, are worthwhile for their durability, flexibility, and relative ease in creation. However, in an age where the creation of public-facing research products is demanded by an increasing range of domains (& funding sources), being able to create interactive, web-based, real-time displays of geospatial data is critical. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are myriad ways to approach this challenge. Hard-core web developers can roll their own websites from scratch in Javascript, HTML, and CSS, leveraging their own data APIs and maintaining their own cyberinfrastructure. Hard-core domain researchers can simply put some easy-to-read plots on a simple website and call it a day. Somewhere in between lies the ability to take an already-polished data analysis pipeline in Python and output the geospatial results to a web-friendly map ready to be hosted on a simple static hosting solution (like your departmental web server or Amazon S3). \n",
    "\n",
    "That's the intent of the Python package [`folium`](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium): to combine data objects in Python with a web mapping framework known as Leaflet to produce interactive geospatial data products on the web. "
